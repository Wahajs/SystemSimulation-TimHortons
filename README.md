The intended goal of this project was to determine optimal staffing levels, measure and reduce the length of the queue through various ordering methods, and achieve an average build time of 90 seconds from order to product pickup. Appropriate utilization of servers and POS systems resulted in a reduction of redundant labor resources. Our findings ensured one-way traffic, limited congestion, resource efficiency, and an enhanced student experience
